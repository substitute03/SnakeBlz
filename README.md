# SnakeBlz
SnakeBlz is a take on the classic Snake game built in Blazor WASM, .NET 6 and C# 10.

## Overview

The aim of the game is to score as many points as possible by guiding the Snake to consume pellets. Each time a pellet is consumed the Snake will become one block longer.
You will get a game over if the Snake either goes out of bounds, or collides with itself.


## Game Modes

- **Classic**
  - A recreation of the classic Snake game. Eat as many pellets as you can without going out of bounds or allowing the Snake to collide with itself.
- **Blazor**
  - Collect pellets to fill up the Blazing meter. When the Blazing meter is full, the Snake will start blazing for 5 seconds. During this time, all pellets
are worth double points and collecting pellets will extend the Blazing status for an extra 1 second.

## Controls

The Snake is controlled using the WASD keys.
